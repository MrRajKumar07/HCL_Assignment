Inventory Management System: Tracking stock levels using key-value pairs.

An *Inventory Management System* 
helps track available stock for products in a store or warehouse.

Each product has:

* A *unique product ID / name*
* A *quantity (stock level)*

A *dictionary (key-value pair)* is used because:

* Product ID → *unique key*
* Stock quantity → *value*
* Fast lookup, update, and deletion
