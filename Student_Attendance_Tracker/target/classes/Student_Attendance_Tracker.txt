Student Attendance Tracker

Requirement Elaboration

Develop a Student Attendance Tracker using Python that records
 daily attendance for students and stores the data in a CSV file.
The system should allow marking students as Present or Absent, 
automatically record the date, and persist the attendance 
data so it can be reviewed later.

This simulates a real-world school or corporate training attendance system, 
focusing on file handling and structured data storage.

Objectives:

Capture daily attendance input from the user
Store attendance records in a persistent CSV file
Ensure data is written in a structured and readable format
Enable easy review of historical attendance data
