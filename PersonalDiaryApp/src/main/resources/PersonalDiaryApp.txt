One-Liner Elaboration (Business Understanding)
A Personal Diary App is a simple system where:
A user maintains daily personal notes
Each diary entry is:
Written on a specific date
Stored persistently in a text file

Users can:
Write a new diary entry
Read previous entries
Data remains available across program runs
Text-based file handler means:
No database is used
Data is stored in .txt files
File I/O (open, read, write, append) is the core mechanism
